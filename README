These scripts can be used to install and deploy glusterfs in a cluster.
It installs the specified version of glusterfs in all the nodes of the
cluster parallelly and reports back the result.
It can be used to create and start a volume in big cluster. Specifications
abou the volume can be set in configfile


Here is a list of each script and what it accomplishes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. run_helper.py

It can be used to run any command in the all the nodes.It assumes that the
passwordless ssh is set between host machine and remote machines. This
script also has the general functions for getting server ip, client ip etc.
This script can take 4 options which is listed below.

'-r' or '--run'  --> run command in the server machines
'-R' or '--Run'  --> same as '-r' but runs in all machines which includes
                     server and clients.
'-c' or '--copy' --> copy file to all the server machines. source path in
                     host and destination in server machines are separated
                     by a ':'
'-C' or '--Copy' --> same as '-c' but copies to all machines which includes
                     both servers and clients.

For example:
./run_helper.py -r 'ifconfig'
Above command runs ifconfig in all server machines and displayes the result
in host machine

./run_helper.py -R 'ifconfig'
This runs above command in both servers and clients and display the result.

./run_helper.py -c /home/source_file:/root/destination_file
Above command copies /home/source_file to all /root/destination_file in all
the servers. Note that the source and destination is separated by ':'.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. buildit.sh

This script just builds the glusterfs tarball. It assumes that configure file
is in 'pwd'. If the prefix path is given as arguement then it installs gluster
in that prefix path. Else default path (/usr/local/sbin/) is used.
This script is used by deploy script to build the glusterfs tarball.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. deploy_gluster.py

This script builds the glusterfs tarball and displays the result to the host
machine console. The version of glusterfs build directory and server and client
ip-address/hostnames should be listed in the 'configfile'. Follow the
descriptions in each feild of 'configfile'
If the seocified version of glusterfs is not present in the 'pwd' then the
script downloads it from bits.gluster.com and installs it.
Installation is always done in both server and client.

Usage Example:
./deploy_gluster.py
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. install_gluster_rpm.py

This scipt installs the gluster via rpms. Version of glusterfs should be
specified in the 'configfile'. Version can be specified as .tar.gz too.
Script has the intelligence to parse the version and install via rpm.

This by default installs only 'core' and 'fuse' rpms. It take take extra
options to install other rpms too.

'-d' or '--debug' --> install glusterfs-debuginfo rpm along with defaults.

'-g' or '--georep' --> Install glusterfs-geo-replication rpm along with defaults.

'-r' or '--rdma' --> Install glusterfs-rdma rpm along with defaults.

'-a' or '--alll' --> Install all glusterfs rpms of specifed version.

For Example:
./install_gluster_rpm.py -r
Installs 'core', 'fuse' and 'rdma' rpms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. create_gluster_vol.py

Creates gluster volume of specifed configuration. volume type, transport type
replica count, stripe count, server export directories all have to be specified
in the config file. replica count and stripe count can be left blank for distribute
only volumes.Follow the descriptions on each feild of configfile for more details.

It can take an additional argument '--start-vol' which also starts volume.

Usage Example;
./create_gluster_vol.py
